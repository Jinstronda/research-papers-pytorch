Implementing Research Papers and projects in Pytorch to understand it in a better way

# Project 1 - MNIST Data Set
Very simple and very easy, was done in less than one hour, worked through it to gain some intuition with Pytorch

Time Spent - 2 Hours

# Project 2 - Fashion MNIST Data Set
Had to gain a bit of familiarity with Convolutional Layers and architectures used before, was very interesting and gave me some insight on Confusion Matrixes and Torch Metrics
Time Spent - About a Week
