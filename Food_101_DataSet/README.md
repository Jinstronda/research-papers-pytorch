Big Fail, tried a TinyVGG and many different architectures but food was just too complicated, showed me a bit of the problems Deep Learning had a few years ago before the rise of huge data sets like IMAGENET and transfer learning became more famous

Great, showed me the power of transfer learning with an accuracy of 83% on the Test Set. Amazing Results




Took me a while to solve this data but i was able to do it using a Pre Trained Model, a tiny architecture didnt work but a pre trained model with 15 epochs (Only on the classification layer) and with all the other layers frozen was great
